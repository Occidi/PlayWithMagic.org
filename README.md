Overview
--------
In the spirit of ensuring that the project's current status is plainly visible at all times, the project's GitHub 
landing page contains Dr. Johnson deliverables for the current milestone.  As we complete the deliverables, we will 
cross them off.  This is distinct from the issues list which contain a lower level of detail and we use our own 
language.

At the completion of the project, these milestones will be replaced by appropriate non-class content.
            
Milestone 1 Status
------------------
~~The goal of the Milestone 1 is to deliver a deployed release of your final project in a manner that satisfies the Three 
Prime Directives and also illustrates at least one “cool” feature of your system.~~

### Deployment
Your milestone release must be deployed. This means that it is available on Heroku, that your team has purchased a 
custom domain name for it, and that this custom domain name resolves to your running instance on Heroku.

### One cool feature
~~Your deployment should illustrate at least one interesting domain-specific feature. If you are unsure after planning 
your milestone release whether it will satisfy this requirement, contact me.~~

### Initial data
~~Your deployment should be “seeded” with a significant amount of high quality, “real world” data. As a first 
approximation, this generally means between 50-100 data items. In general, don’t “make up” your initial data, go out 
into the real world and gather it manually, then enter it into your deployed system by hand. You will learn a great 
deal about the proper design of your system and the domain you are working in through this process, so be sure to 
allocate enough time for it.~~

~~You can seed your system on startup with this initial data through the Global class, as demonstrated in the Digits 
system.~~

### Database
~~Build an in-memory database “mockup” similar to the Digits ContactDB class.~~

### Authorization and authentication
For the first milestone, I do not recommend that you spend time implementing authorization (i.e. role-based page access)
 or authentication (i.e. login). ~~No proposed project uses authorization or authentication in an interesting way.~~

~~Instead, either design your first milestone release with public access to all pages, or else initialize your system 
with a set of users and provide a simple mechanism for setting the user in the session object.~~

### Quality Assurance
~~Your system should pass Checkstyle and should contain Integration Tests that (at a minimum) retrieve each page and 
submit~~ all ~~most forms.~~

### Satisfy the project management guidelines
~~Regardless of whether you are working alone or in a group, you must satisfy the Project Management Guidelines.~~

I will be periodically checking your issue lists as part of evaluating how well you are managing your project.

~~Be sure to publish your home page using GitHub pages. For an example, see Play Example Form.~~

### Satisfy the three prime directives
~~To satisfy the first directive, your milestone must implement an interesting feature.~~

To satisfy the second directive, you must provide a User Guide wiki page that documents how a user can use the system.

~~To satisfy the third directive, you must provide a Developer Guide wiki page that documents how to download, build, 
extend, test, and collaborate with other developers.~~

Your documentation should document the current version of the system, not some future version.

### Submission instructions

#### FP3 Submission Part A: In-class demo
On the date and time listed on the schedule page, your team will present a 5-10 minute demo of your system in class. 
Using my laptop, you will show the deployed instance running on Heroku and also provide a guided tour of your repo and 
your Issues.

#### FP3 Submission Part B: Technical essay
By 9pm on the evening before the date and time listed on the schedule page for the Milestone 1 demo, you should 
complete a technical essay discussing your experiences completing this milestone.

Present a brief summary of what your system is ultimately designed to do, along with a summary of what the initial 
milestone release accomplishes. Provide a link to the deployed instance and your GitHub repo.

Also discuss project management: what has worked well so far, and what you want to improve for the next milestone.

Send me an email with a link to this essay. The subject line should be [ICS 613: FP3].
