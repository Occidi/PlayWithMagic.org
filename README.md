Introduction
------------
Over their careers, magicians see countless routines, learn thousands of methods, slights, banter, gaffs and
effects (for now, we'll call them effects).  This catalog allows magicians to cite where they 
learned the effect.  Who or what influenced it.  How they have personalized it.  Magicians 
have the option to share the effect with others.  Some effects work well together, there is
an interface for linking effects as lead-ins, transitions or full-circles.  Finally, the 
application will have a “Routine Builder” that helps magicians with possibly the most 
difficult part of preparing a set — taking all of the effects they know and stitching them 
into a cohesive routine.
