The hard part is choreographing a show from a diverse set of routines.\r\nOver their careers, magicians see countless acts, learn thousands of methods, slights, banter and gaffs\r\n(collectively called routines).  This web application allows magicians to catalog their routines.  Magicians\r\ncan cite where they learned it, who or what influenced it and how they personalized it.  Magicians\r\nhave the option to share their routines with others.  The benefit of cataloging routines is access the crowdsourced\r\npool of routines that feed a “Set Builder”.  The set builder filters routines and sequences them into a cohesive set.\r\nMagicians can identify routines for their set by searching the catalog and adding them into a shopping cart.  A routine\r\nrecommendation engine could prompt magicians to consider routines that are popular, utilize similar materials or take\r\nthem out of their comfort zone.\r\n\r\nUser Guide\r\n----------\r\n\r\nA helpful User Guide is available on the [PlayWithMagic.org Wiki](https://github.com/PlayWithMagic/PlayWithMagic.org/wiki/User-Guide).\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloper Guide\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nPlayWithMagic.org is an Open Source project, and anyone can contribute!
