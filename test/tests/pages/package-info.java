/**
 * Scaffolding test pages for a Fluentlenium Model-View-Controller web application.
 *
 * This application uses the PageObjects design pattern.  A page object is a class that serves as an interface to
 * the page in the application.  Tests use methods exposed in the Page (actually FluidPage) objects whenever they
 * need to interact with the page.  The benefit is that if the UI changes in that page, the tests themselves don't
 * need to change.  All of the change is centralized in a method of the PageObject.  All changes to support the UI
 * are located in one place.
 *
 * This design pattern provides the following advantages:
 *   - A clean separation between the test code and page specific code.
 *   - A single repository for all of the services or operations offered by a page.
